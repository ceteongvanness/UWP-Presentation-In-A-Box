Universal Windows Platform Presentations
==========

As a Microsoft MVP, we want to make spreading the word about UWP to app developers as easy as possible. For some of our favorite topics, we have collected presentations, demos, and recordings of prior Microsoft sessions, and we have made them available for you.  Whether you are presenting at User Group, conference or hosting your own event, we hope this content will be helpful for sharing any or all of these topics with the community.  

As part of a pilot program, you will also find the form to complete to request reimbursement for certain catering, venue, travel, or conference expenses related to your efforts in sharing UWP with the world.   More details on the reimbursement process can be found on the “Reimbursement Form.”


##ARE YOU INTERESTED?  HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

-	STEP 1 – GET PRE-APPROVAL -  In advance of the event, please complete the [reimbursement form](https://github.com/Microsoft/PresentationInABox/blob/master/Reimbursement%20Request%20Form.docm). Details needed will include type of event, audience, date, location, expected number of attendees, approximate budget request. 
-	STEP 2 – PRESENT AT YOUR EVENT– include a single slide pointing devs to a specific URL
-	STEP 3 – REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT 
	
	After the event, email our team at [mvpenabl@microsoft.com](mailto:mvpenabl@microsoft.com "mvpenabl@microsoft.com") with the following information and we will confirm receipt:

		1)	Name, email, phone number
		2)	Invoice, with payment terms “due upon receipt”

	Provide payment details - within a week of your request, you will receive an email from Payment Central with your next steps.  Please respond with confirmation of your payment preferences and location for payment.   

	Please note:  reimbursement will be in US dollars (USD). 

##TOPICS

For the purposes of this pilot, **reimbursement is only available for the delivery of content on the below topics**.

We encouraged to push your content to this repo to share with other MVPs in who could use it.

##PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLE

For each topic, we have provided a PowerPoint presentation (with speaker notes where available), demos, abstract and a link to the live presentation delivered by Microsoft.  We encourage you to edit these to make them your own. There is a single slide we ask you to include in each presentation, encouraging developers to sign up for ongoing communication with our team.
